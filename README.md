# Universal-Navigation-for-3D-programs
AHK script that makes you use the same buttons for 3ds Max, Maya and Zbrush. 

# Instructions
1. Since Windows doesnt use F13-F22 keys, I have bound <b> F17 as orbit, F16 as Pan and F15 as Zoom-Dolly </b>.
2. All you need to do is add F17, F16, F15 to your macro key either on your keyboard or a mouse that has macro keys. I personally used Razer Naga, Logitech g600, Corsair schimitar Pro
