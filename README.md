# Universal-Navigation-for-3D-programs
AHK script that makes you use the same buttons for 3ds Max, Maya and Zbrush. 

# Instructions
Since Windows doesnt use F13-F22 keys, I have bound F17 as orbit, F16 as Pan and F15 as Zoom-Dolly.
All you need to do is add F17, F16, F15 to your macro key either on your keyboard or a mouse that has macro keys. I personally used Razer Naga and Logitech g600
